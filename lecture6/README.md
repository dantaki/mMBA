## Reframing Organizations

*4 frames/perpesctive of the organization*

  * structure
2. Family
  * human resources
3. Jungle
  * power and politics

`Talented leader can see all four views, speak their language, and understand`

#### Structural Perspective

Positional power gives a leader the authority to influence **what people do**

Organize and coordinate work. Leader is like an architect. 

Simplistic use of positional power: *carrot and sticks*
`how to go beyond carrot and sticks`

#### Human Resources Perspective
`family lens`

`What's the right fit for this person?`

Positional power gives a leader the opportunity to **empower** and **serve** others. 

Leader is a catalyst 

What happens to a bad fit? *Self-destruction, saboteurs*

#### Political Perspective
`jungle lens`

Positional power is used by leaders to influence **what people want**

`who lit you up [lol]` :joy: 

Leader is impactful. Leader is an advocate, goes to battle for people in an organization. 

Descisions are made differently, influenced by conflict, power is currency. Create a strategy to achieve. 

#### Cultural Perspective
`temple lens`

Leaders impart meaning and purpose by interpreting workplace experinences using the symbols and language of shared organizational culture. 

Leader as a prophet that holds people together to a mission for the goals of the organization.
