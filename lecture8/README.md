`S + R = E`

*S*ituation
  * not always in your control
  * cannot always change the situation
*R*esponse

*E*xperience<sub>*Result*</sub>

## Response:
3 ways to respond to a situation to affect the result of the outcome

:volcano:

 1. Internal Dialogue
 2. Mental Imagery
 3. Behavior 

Be responsive instead of reactive :neckbeard: 
*avoid flipping the lid*<sub>*Amygdala Intensifies*</sub>

### Mindful Responding
Slow down the response to create some space and time for stressful stituations

:traffic\_light: :busstop:

* **S**top
* **T**ake a slow deep breath
* **O**bserve/reflect
* **P**roceed

### Ego Depletion 

Ego is a depletable resource *fueled by glucose* 
When depleted :arrow\_right: less control :heavy_plus_sign: less willpower

### Mood Meter

*Range from -5 to +5*

| Energy Level | Feeling | Quadrant | Mindset | 
| -------------| ------  | -------- | ------- |
| High         | Unpleasent | Red   | Determined | 
| High         | Pleasant   | Yellow | Flexible |
| Low          | Unpleasent | Blue   | Critical | 
| Low          | Pleasant   | Green  | Reflective | 

#### Mindset 

Self-Awareness

* Determined: Persuasive Speaking
* Flexible: Brainstorming, creative spouts, more likely to miss errors
* Critical: Proofings & Editing, good for work for self-critiism, find errors 
* Reflective: building a consensus, esp. in a team

Currently I am a +1 Feeling, +1 Energy = Yellow. Word = Here 

1. How did you get here?
  * *I ate a good lunch :hamburger: and I feel like I didn't waste my day*
2. How is it being expressed for you?
  * *I'm not sure I understand this question, my posture is ok and I feel relaxed*
3. What's your strategy to get the most of the remaining time (of the class)?
  * *Everything is going well, I'm going to pay attention and probably stop looking up emojis for github*

Self-management comes before other management. Moving between the "quadrants" 
Self-Awareness comes before Self-Manafement 

Primary problem with executives in their career: emotation competience

* difficulty in handling change
* not being able to work well on a team
* poor interpersonal relations

#### Self-Assessment

* What makes a conversation challenging for me is 
* What I do well in difficult conversations
* Triggers that push my buttons
* What I've seen others do well in tough conversations that I would like to do

#### Big Ideas

:bulb: :thought\_balloon:

* Set Context
  * `I would like to hear your point of view ...`
* Listen to Understand
* Express Yourself
* Solve Problem
* Manage Emotions
* Follow-Up
  * can be a process

##### Set the Context

* why is this conversation important to have?
* what's likely to happen if you don't have the conversation
* know your outcome/objective for the conversation
  * could be to share information, how something has impacted you
* set and expectation
* opening statement that reinforces all of the above
  * :speech\_balloon: *"I'd like to hear your thoughts on this problem and to express my own... I think we should take some time to problem-solve. How does that sound to you?"*

##### Listen to Understand

* ask clarifying questions
* summarize occasionally
* breathe :cloud: 

### Difficult Conversations

Types

1. What happened :confused: 
2. Feeling conversation :sob:
3. Identity conversation :anguished:

#### What Happened

:speech\_balloon: *I think I'm right*

* conclusions support self-interest
* move from certainty to curiosity
* **Bottom Line:** have some humility 

* do not assume they meant it
* assumptions about intentions are often **wrong**
* **we assume intentions from the impact on us (hurt/slighted)**

* avoid blame and focus on contribution
  * blame is in the past
  * contribution is the future
* role reversal or third position observation

#### Feeing Conversation

:thought\_balloon: Know Your Emotional Footprint

* _Judgments_: :speech\_balloon: "If you were a good friendd you would have been there for me"
* _Attributions_: :speech\_balloon: "Why you hurt me"
* _Characteristics_: :speech\_ballon: "you're just so X"
* _Problem Solving_

#### Identity Conversations

* All or Nothing syndrome
* Exaggeration
* Denial 
  * :speech\_balloon: "You're full of it!" 
* Use the "And" modifier 

#### open the Conversation

:speech\_balloon: "I noticed ... and I was wondering/thinking/feeling ..."

:scissors: :scissors: :scissors: `SISIR` :scissors: :scissors: :scissors:

* Situation (*I noticed...*)
* Input (*What happened?*)
* Summarize (*So, you...*)
* Impact (*As a result ...*)
* Request (*We need to... Would you be willing to ..?*)
