## Strategy Primer

* Piecemeal strategy -> A Mess

Understanding strategic terminology is important

* Strategy 
  * Complex but make it specific to your needs
  * Very Specific
    * deadlines, plans, unambiguous 
  * Building relationships
    * 
  * Plan for growth 
    * Avoid weak or self-destructing growth 
  * Not synonymous with long-term
  * One objective
    * Has goals
    * Tactics: very specific operation things to do: people to hire, facilities to open up
      * things to do to meet your goal 
  * Positioning: how well the organization is positioned
    * remain relevant 

Success Strategies
1. Lowest Cost
2. Differentiated Position: "new thing no one else has" 

Things firms leverage as part of their strategic positions
* companies that need working capital. Typically want to scale up
  * break through tech
  * streamlined process
  * major cost advantage
  * exclusive market access
  * new distribution method
  * enhance other platforms 

Benefits / Cost = Value
Improve Value: New benefits / same cost, benefits / lower cost, ultimately desire more benefits but lower price


### Success Metrics
 
* Business Model:
  MBV: Margin, Burn, Volume
	* Margin:
	* Burn: overhead costs
	* Volume: 

* Sales

* Gross + Net Margins EBITDA (what you make on each product before tax) 

* Return: investment, equity, internal rate of return, firm value: stock price 

* Market Share & New Customers 
 
#### Strategy defines internal operation

Strategy is never defined by operations. Operations after strategic plans (place tactics in place)

Internal operations support strategy, but is not an operations support

#### Best Take-Aways

* Strategy is needed, formal planned idea
* Don't build strategies around operations
* 2 effective strategies: technological monopoly or lowest price 
* Senior members should focus on strategic problems not operational problems.

## Building Strategy

1. Examine the External Environment
  * Start by looking at the externals
  * Anticipated future of the market
  * Actionable intelligence from the environment: get a good feel of the anticipated change ("Turbulence") 
  * Drives strategy
2. Audit Internal Functional Capabilities
  * Strategic Posture 
  * Functional Capabilities
    * Production: ability to produce/deliver a service
    * Marketing: 
    * Finance and accounting: 
    * Legal: IP/Contracts 
    * Customer Service
    * IT: databases
3. Positioning Exposes Gaps
  * Positioning: where the external needs meet the internal capabilities 
  * Strategic Gaps
     * gaps poorly position organization for the future
4. Close Gaps
  * Requires:
    * Time 
    * Resources
      * Personnel 
      * Capital (cash)
5. Execute, Monitor, and Assess
  * Default strategic objective: "we are going to be well positioned in the future anticipated external environment"
  * Assess strategies and hold people accountable
  * Senior team oversees strategic execution 

* External Environment
  * Requires: Sensing/Monitoring 
  * Actively monitor external environment and make actionable items to respond to it
* Internal 
  * functional audit, should be honest 
* Positioning
  * posture on environment
* Plan 
  * How to close the gaps
  * How to reposition
* Metrics
  * assess success 

### Turbulence Scale

1. Repetitive
  * Stable, being reliable 
  * Best Capability: be custodial
  * Response: Stability

2. Expanding
  * Market is growing, more buyers 
  * Best Capability: production
  * Response: Reactive

3. Changing
 * incremental changes, predictable, but advancing
 * Best Capability: Marketing. Sending the message that the product is better etc... 
 * Response: Anticipatory changes
 
4. Discontinuous
 * Best Capability: Strategic 
 * Response: Entrepreneurial 

5. Surprise/Shock
  * Best Capability: Flex/Pivot
  * Response: Creative/Pre-emptive

### Building Strategy Reading

* *Seeing What's Next* 
> Clayton Christensen, Scott Anthony, Erik Roth

1. Clear Change Signals: what is this
2. Competitive Battles: what does this mean
3. Strategic Choice: how do you interpret options 

* *Process Innovation: reengineering work through information technology* 
> Thomas Davenport

R+D Re-engineering, re-design 
process innovation (incremental) 
Compound savings (little bit at a time/ here and there) 

Continuous Improvement: 

Discontinuous Improvement: 
 
* *Renewable Advantage* 
> Jeffery Williams

"Renewability Advantage"
  * recognize products are either: 
    * slow-cycle
    * standard cycle
    * fast-cycle

Isolating Mechanisms: 
  * Value:
    1. Arises (hot new product)
    2. Decays/Plateaus
    3. Renewed

3 Strategies:
  * Convergence: lots of opportunity 
  * Alignment: go along with the leader 
  * Renewal: R+D team, internal change agent

Strategic Staircase (apple,amazon,google):

* *On Competition* 
> Michael Porter

#### Porter's 5 Forces

1. Supplier Bargaining Power
2. Buyer Bargaining Power
3. Rivalry Among Existing Competitors
4. Threat of Substitute Products or Services
5. New Entrants Threats
 
Understand and map these 5 forces == good handle of the market 

### Best Take-Aways

* Before starting a strategy, examine the external market, and the future external market
* Need leadership that understands the external environment 
* Benchmarks for strategy, check if the gaps are closed (timelines, deliverables, benchmarks) 
* What are we going to use to know if something is working. Measure performance well
* Innovation needs to be ongoing

## Strategic Management

### Igor Ansoff

| :arrow_down:  | Existing Products  | New Products | 
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| *Existing Markets*  | Market Penetration | Product Development |  
| *New Markets*       | Market Development | Diversification     | 

### Timing for Actionable Intelligence 

Ansoff's model, 20% is required to make a move. People who pull the trigger on 80% knowledge miss out on opportunities 

Knowledge increases overtime. 

* Strong Signal = linear, predictable, companies should be fairly well to respond to strong signals
* Weak Signal = time period from 20-80% is really short. There's not a lot of time to respond to a weak signal. 

When making decisions, why not have internal assessment on externals and adapt to them when others cannot? 

### Strategic Management Cube 

1. Problems
  * Internal
    * Configuration 
    * Dynamics
  * External 
    * Transaction: with other companies
    * Adaptation

2. Process
  * Sense
  * Decide
  * Execute

3. Lens
  * Political (my turf/your turf)
  * Psycho-Social (get along/best case)
  * Cognitive/Logic Optics == Best Strategies 

#### Keys to Strategic Management: 

* Near Strategic: Transaction, execute, cognitive
* Optimal Strategy: Adaptive, Execute, Cognitive 

### Newton Strategy Matrix

* Resources (personnel/capital): 
  * Sufficient or Lacking

* Time: 
  * Yes or No

|  :arrow_down:  | Sufficient | Lacking |
| --- | ---------- | ------- |
| *Yes* |  1         |  2      | 
| *No*  |  3         |  4      |

1. Ideal 
2. Finding partnerships, people that have resources. 
3. Find acquisitions: get the functional capability
4. Pivot & Adapt

### Newton Strategy Execute

When do you make your Move? 

| :arrow_down: | Early | Mid    | Late |
| ---- | ----  | ------ | ---- |
| **Good Outcome** | Lead  | Pack   | Lag   |
| **Bad Outcome**  | Alone | Behind | Missed Opportunity | 

### Strategic Business Unit Model

Industry Maturity: Embryonic, Growth, Mature, Aging
 
| *Position*  | Embryonic | Growth    | Mature  | Aging     |
| --------  | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| *Leading*   | Build     | Build     | Build     | Build     |
| *Strong*    | Build     | Build     | Build     | Maintain  |
| *Favorable* | Build     | Build     | Maintain  | Liquidate |
| *Tenable*   | Build     | Maintain  | Liquidate | Liquidate |
| *Weak*      | Maintain  | Liquidate | Liquidate | Liquidate |
| *Nonviable* | Liquidate | Liquidate | Liquidate | Liquidate |

### Strategic Managment Reading

* *On Strategy* 
> Boston Consulting Group 

| :arrow_down: | Low Market Share   | High Market Share | 
| ----------- | -----------------  | ----------------  |
| *High Growth* |  Question Marks    |  Stars            |
| *Low Growth*  | Dogs               | Cash cows         |

* Stars: High Market Shared & High Market Growth
* Cash Cows: high Market Share & Low Market Growth 

* Question Marks/Problem Child: Low Market Share & High Market Growth (keep throwing money at it and nothing changes)
* Dogs: Low Market Share & Low Market Growth 

## Best Take-Aways

* Delivering on strategy is meeting the expectations on your target market
* Do you have all the right functional capabilities, closing the gaps
* Be objective on your strategy planning. 
* Timing is important, make sure you have the right resources
