## Outline

* Time Value of Money
  * present and future values
* Valuation 
* Model of Risk-Return Tradeoff
  * CAPM
* Capital budgeting rules:
  * NPV
  * IRR
  * PI
  * ROI

## Case Studies

Valuation model is based on assuptions. Usually about the future, which uncertancy plays a role. 

* Uber: selling $2.1B for ~3% of the company's worth == $62.5B evaluation. 

* Biotech Sector: risks are paying off. 

* Pandora: IPO @ $16; valued at $2.56B

Should you invest in X?

  * is the company *really* valued that $N market cap?
  * what are the risks and expected returns?
  * how was the company valued?

**Pandora Evaluation**

| 2011 | 2017 | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| $2.5B | $2B | 

Return is negative if one invested from 2011 until now. 

Founder was eager to secure funding, sold a lot of the company to early investors.

**Fallacy**: *I'll keep the stock until it makes money*

Volatility (mearsure of variance of the return) one way to measure risk.

## Overview and Perspective

Essential question:

*How to allocate resources in order to amass the most wealth while being exposed to the least amount of risk?*

  * Invest in A or B?
  * When do I invest (timing)?
  * How do I invest? (Real estate, stocks, etc...) 

Asset: *anything that as a positive value in exchange*
 * Real: used to produce goods and services
 * Financial: claims on real assets 

General Problem: 
* Allocate real assets today to their most productive use
  * across assets 
* Allocate real assets over time 
  * across time

### Axioms

1. Assets tomorrow are worth less than assets today 
  * time value of money
  * makes no assuption about risk
2. Markets participants prefer more assets to less
3. Market participants don't like risk
4. People are rational; markets are competitive
  * based on the same information, people make the same decisions
  
### Classes of Assets

1. Equity 
  * variable income
    * common/preferred stocks
  * Return: unknown ex-ante

2. Debt
  * fixed income
    * bonds, money market funds, T-bills, CoD
  * Safer than equity: debtholders get paid first 
  * Interest (coupon): contractual obligation
  * Return: unknown ex-ante

3. Derivatives
  * value is derived from an underlying asset
    * options, futures, swaps, credit default swaps 

### Time Value of Money 

Compound investment 

**Future Value** = *FV<sub>n</sub>*  = *PV<sub>0</sub>*(1+r)<sup>2</sup>
  * *FV<sub>n</sub>*: Future Value at period n
  * *PV<sub>0</sub>*: Present Value (at period 0)
  * r: Rate between two periods
  * n: number of periods

Turn it around *"say you want $200k in 18 years... how much to put aside today? (assuming 8% annual interest rate)"*

  *PV<sub>0</sub>* = *FV<sub>n</sub>* / (1+r)<sup>n</sup> 

  *PV<sub>0</sub>* = $200k / (1+0.08)<sup>18</sup> = $50,049.81 

The more we discount the future (higher r) the lower the PV of the project (for fixed cash flows) 

* can we assime that r= risk free rate? (5%) 
* can r be lower than the risk free rate? 
* if r is highter than the risk free rate, how much higher? 

Perpetuity: investment that makes constant payments (forever)
