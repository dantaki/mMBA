:poop: `Use these tools to make better decisions` :poop:

## Value of Business Analytics 

:scream: *Conjoint Analysis*: asked to evaluate different product profiles. Helps analyze trade-offs customers are willing to make. 

Limitations of using analytics

:mega::exclaimation: `Relying on business analytics will limit the range of posible new products and services`

There is a general danger that customers do not know what they want.

:mega::exclaimation: Sometimes business analytics is not the solution 

:mega:exclaimation: Testing with customers has a lot of value.

## When Not to Use Business Analytics

:shit::shit::shit::shit::shit:

*Information Gaps*

:scream: Which ones to use for business analytics 
 
* Known-Knowns :neckbeard: 
  * In a business context, there is few known-knowns
  * Probably not the first thing to do research on, focus on teh information gaps
  * Revisit known-knowns at a later time

* Known-Unknowns :rage:
  * Important for a business aspect 
  * Focus more time and money on this informaiton gap  

* Unknown-Unknows :scream:
  * Exploritory research
  * Not the easiest type but should still be explored

*Backward Business Analytics*

Basic template for consulting companies 

* What does the manager expect to get out of the project
* What should the final report contain
* How would the results be implemented?
  * scenarios :wink:
* Create action tables :cat::mushroom::cat: 

:mega: It can be extremely valuable to think backwards

:cat: `start the process where it usually ends and then work backwards` :cat: 

`~ B U S I N E S S ~ A N A L Y T I C S ~  I N ~ A C T I O N ~`

#### Case A 

:moneybag:

* Cost: 100k
* 60% chance of success $4M
* 40% chance of failure $1M

:joy::dollar: D O I T!!! :joy::dollar:

#### Case B

* Cost 100k
* 60% success: $4M
* 40% failure: -$2.5
* $0 if no introduction

:mega::mega::mega::gun:

Expected Value(No Research)= (0.6)*$4M +(0.4)*-$2.5 = $1.4M
Expected Value(w/ Research)= (0.6)*$4M + (0)*-$2.5 = $2.4M 

Maximum to pay for the Reseach $2.4-$1.4 = $1M 

#### Case C

* 60% success: $0.4M
* 40% failure: -$0.25M
* Cost 100k
* Research costs $100k

Maximum willingness to pay: $100k

The value of a business analytic project depends on
* can the decision be affected by the project outcome
* is the investment meaningful?
* is there significant uncertainty about action outcomes?

## Big Data

:scream::scream:`I T S S O B I G`:scream::scream:

1. Collect Underpaints
2. ????????
3. PROFIT!!!! :moneybag::dollar::moneybag:

The Four Vs of Big Data:

* Volume: scale of data
* Velocity: analysis of streaming data
* Variety: different froms of data
* Veracity: uncertainty of data

:shit::shit::shit: Common mistakes: lack of a business problem

Lego approach: issues lead to data -:exclaimation:- not data leads to issues.
Data hoarding happens when data drive issues.
